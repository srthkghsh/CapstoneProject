# Car Traffic Counting with Speech Recognition

This project uses TensorFlow.js and the Speech Commands library to implement a car traffic counting system. By leveraging the power of machine learning and speech recognition, the system can detect and count the number of cars passing by a certain area.

## How It Works

The project utilizes a pre-trained machine learning model that has been trained on various speech commands, including specific car-related words. The model analyzes audio input captured from a microphone or audio source and predicts the corresponding speech command.

To count the number of cars passing by, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Click the "Start" button to initialize the speech recognition model.
4. Allow access to your microphone when prompted.
5. As cars pass by, the system will recognize the corresponding speech command and display the prediction with a confidence score.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following dependencies:

- TensorFlow.js (v1.3.1): JavaScript library for training and deploying machine learning models in the browser.
- Speech Commands (v0.4.0): Library for recognizing speech commands using machine learning models.

These dependencies are loaded from the respective CDN URLs mentioned in the code.

## Usage and Customization

The current implementation uses a pre-trained model hosted on the Teachable Machine platform. However, you can train your own model using the Teachable Machine platform and export it for TensorFlow.js. Once you have your custom model, update the `URL` constant in the JavaScript code to point to your model's URL.

Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs and customize the display of the speech command predictions. You can adjust the `probabilityThreshold` to control the confidence threshold for predictions and modify the code to perform specific actions based on the recognized commands.

## Limitations

- The accuracy and performance of the speech recognition system depend on the quality of the microphone and the training of the model.
- The system may have limitations in noisy environments or when speech commands are not clearly spoken.
- The project currently focuses on recognizing speech commands related to cars, but it can be expanded to include other commands or adapt to different contexts.
